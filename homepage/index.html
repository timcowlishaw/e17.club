It's a place for Walthamstow locals to learn about computing and the internet,
show off their creativity, and make friends.

It's loosely based on the <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">ideas</a> behind <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>, but with an added pinch of localism.

E17 club has two rules:
  - Be nice to each other
    (This means:
      - No hacking or attempting to hack other users accounts, and
      - Abide by the <a href="http://tilde.club/~anthonydpaul/primer.html">Geek Feminism Anti-Harrasment policy</a>)
  - Don't do anything illegal.

E17 club is overseen by <a href="http://e17.club/~tim">Tim Cowlishaw</a> [<a href="mailto:tim@timcowlishaw.co.uk">email</a>],
please get in touch with him with any questions or requests, or if you'd like to join!

Have fun!
